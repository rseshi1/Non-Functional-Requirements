# Unveiling Non-Functional Requirements in Web Applications: A Detailed Exploration with KPIs and Real-World Examples

## Introduction

Non-functional requirements (NFRs) are the backbone of web application development, ensuring performance, scalability, security, and more. This article will dissect various NFRs, providing real-world examples and detailed Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to underscore their significance.

## 1. Performance

- **Example**: An e-commerce site aims for a maximum page load time of 2 seconds.
- **KPI**: Average Page Load Time (PLT) measured using tools like Google PageSpeed Insights or New Relic. Achieving a PLT of 1.5 seconds indicates successful performance optimization.

## 2. Scalability

- **Example**: A social media platform anticipates handling a 300% increase in users during peak periods.
- **KPI**: Scalability Ratio – the percentage increase in users compared to baseline capacity. Achieving a ratio of 300% demonstrates the platform’s ability to scale effectively.

## 3. Security

- **Example**: A banking application aims for a 0% data breach rate.
- **KPI**: Data Breach Rate – the percentage of security incidents resulting in unauthorized access. Maintaining a data breach rate of 0% indicates robust security measures and compliance with industry standards.

## 4. Reliability

- **Example**: An online booking system targets an uptime of 99.99%.
- **KPI**: System Uptime – measured as the percentage of time the system is operational. Achieving a system uptime of 99.99% means the system experiences less than 1 hour of downtime per year.

## 5. Usability

- **Example**: A content management system (CMS) aims for a 90% user satisfaction rate.
- **KPI**: User Satisfaction Score – obtained through surveys or user feedback. A user satisfaction score of 90% indicates high usability and positive user experience.

## 6. Maintainability

- **Example**: A SaaS application targets a code maintainability index of 90.
- **KPI**: Code Maintainability Index – a numerical score measuring code complexity, duplication, and clarity. Achieving a score of 90 indicates clean, maintainable code.

## 7. Compliance

- **Example**: A healthcare application adheres to HIPAA regulations with a 100% compliance rate.
- **KPI**: Compliance Rate – the percentage of regulatory requirements met. A compliance rate of 100% indicates full adherence to regulations and data protection standards.

## 8. Latency

- **Example**: A real-time messaging application aims for a maximum latency of 100 milliseconds.
- **KPI**: Round-Trip Latency – measured as the time taken for a message to be sent and received. Achieving a latency of 100 milliseconds ensures responsive communication.

## 9. High Availability

- **Example**: An e-commerce platform targets a 99.99% availability rate during peak shopping seasons.
- **KPI**: Availability Rate – the percentage of time the system is available for use. Maintaining an availability rate of 99.99% ensures uninterrupted service for customers.

## Conclusion

By incorporating detailed KPIs and real-world examples, this article highlights the critical role of non-functional requirements in shaping the success and reliability of web applications. Meeting these requirements not only enhances user experience but also ensures the long-term viability and scalability of the application.# Non-Functional-Requirements
