# Pre-production Checklist

This checklist contains points that must be satisfied during implementation and verified prior to release.

Please note that all items in the design checklist that were verified at the end of the design phase, must still be satisfied at release time (e.g. the design doc must be up-to-date, the SLOs must be consistent, ...).

## ðŸ”§ Maintainability

Maintainability affects team productivity and system availability. If maintainability is low, the team will take a longer time to change the service in production and it will cause longer MTTR (Mean Time To Recover) in case of failures.

## ðŸ“‰ Observability

Observability affects team productivity and system availability. If observability is low, the team will take a longer time to notice/investigate a problem occurred in production. And it will make MTTR (Mean Time To Recover) longer.
